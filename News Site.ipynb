Just days after taking Bryson DeChambeau to the final hole at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Englishman added a 66 to his first-round 69 and leads by one shot from Matthew Fitzpatrick at the Players Championship.</p> <p>McIlroy has admitted a desire to add more length to his game, fuelled in part by DeChambeau’s power play at the 2020 US Open, has triggered technical problems that were visible here. A second round of 75 at Sawgrass, added to Thursday’s 79, meant McIlroy comfortably missed the cut.

So I’m sort of fighting to get back out of that. That’s what I’m frustrated with.”</p> <p>When asked why he had embarked on such a journey, McIlroy’s answer raised eyebrows. “I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t anything to do with what Bryson did at the US Open,” said the four-times major winner. “I think a lot of people saw that and were like, ‘Whoa, if this is the way they’re going to set golf courses up in the future, it helps. It really helps.’</p> <p>“The one thing that people don’t appreciate is how good Bryson is out of the rough. Not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard, so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us, than other guys. I thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing, I got there.

The council emerged from closed session to announce the move, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/11/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-jury-selection-new-charge-possible\">Derek Chauvin trial: judge grants request to add third-degree murder charge</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>The Floyd family attorney, Ben Crump, said in a prepared statement that it was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit, and “sends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end”.</p> \\n<p>Floyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former police officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd’s death sparked mass protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a national reckoning on racial justice.</p> \\n<p>“I hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,” the council president, Lisa Bender, said. “But I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.”</p> \\n<p>Floyd’s sister, Bridgett Floyd, said in a statement: “On behalf of all of my family members, I am pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved.”</p> \\n<p>She added: “Our family suffered an irreplaceable loss May 25 when George’s life was senselessly taken by a Minneapolis police officer. While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.”</p> \\n<p>Floyd’s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd’s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.</p> \\n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \\n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/06/minneapolis-george-floyd-my-home-town\">Minneapolis on trial: how the year of George Floyd changed me and my city</a> </p> \\n</aside> \\n<p>George Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, said of the settlement: “Even though my brother is not here, he’s here with me in my heart. If I could get him back, I would give all this back.”</p> \\n<p>“That dollar amount shows that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. It goes to show that we matter but it’s an opportunity to show that these types of injustices are wrong. It was a clear violation of George Floyd’s civil rights. It shouldn’t have happened,” said Todd Gramenz of Black Lives Matter St Paul.</p> \\n<p>Black Lives Matter Saint Paul was established in 2014 after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\">Michael Brown was killed </a>in Ferguson. They have been organizing protests and lobbying since then.</p> \\n<p>Gramenz added that you cannot really put a dollar value on a life. “How do you value a Black man, who’s innocent, that’s killed?” he said, and called for more police who kill to stand trial.</p> \\n<p>Only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted a murder before, a Black officer who killed a white women, yet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/mar/08/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-trial-minneapolis\">several hundred</a> Minnesotans have suffered police-involved deaths in the last 20 years.</p> \\n<p>It was not immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it will be hard to stop jurors or potential jurors from hearing about it.</p> \\n<p>“Judge Cahill will likely explain to the jurors that each must make a decision based solely on the evidence they hear in the criminal trial,” Daly said.</p> \\n<p>Any praise for the settlement overlooks “how many families that have failed to get a settlement and how they have failed to hold police accountable”, DJ Hooker from the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar campaign group told the Guardian.</p> \\n<p>He added: “It’s good that we see that this happened with the $27m but on top of that, we need to make sure that happens for all families affected by police brutality. Everyone doesn’t get the same amount. It’s not fair. Everyone needs to be able to get money when their loved ones die.”</p> \\n<p>However, Hooker said holding police officers accountable and protecting the community by preventing brutality and violence was vital.</p> \\n<p>L Chris Stewart, an attorney who worked with Floyd’s family, said the size of the settlement “changes evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die”.</p> \\n<p>“And what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, ‘Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?’ They have 27m reasons now why they should,” he said.</p> \\n<p>Meanwhile, with jury selection in its fourth day, seven<strong> </strong>people have been seated so far, with the jury roughly balanced between white people and people of color, according to the authorities.</p> \\n<p>Opening statements are expected around 29 March.</p> \\n<p><br></p>'},\n",

Forty-seven state senators have already said Cuomo should step down, more than the 46 needed to convict the governor if he was impeached.</p> <p>Separately, police in Albany said that they have been notified of the allegations and that these “may have risen to the level of a crime” although this does not mean they have opened a criminal investigation.</p> <p>Cuomo had previously denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of women, although he has provided a general apology if any of his previous actions made anyone feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>On Friday, Cuomo, who was attorney general of New York and Bill Clinton’s housing secretary and is the son of the late governor Mario Cuomo, said: “I am not part of the political club.”</p> <p>He said it wasn’t clear why all the sexual misconduct allegations had been made now. He said they should be taken very seriously, but he denied any inappropriate conduct.</p> <p>“Look, it’s very simple: I never harassed someone. I’ve never abused anyone,” Cuomo said.</p> <p>“You need to know the facts before you make a decision,” he said, referring to his critics. “People know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth.”</p> <p>On the nursing home deaths, the governor has previously claimed his administration had to verify deaths of residents at hospitals, but critics questioned why that hadn’t held up the release of data in other states. Cuomo’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Along with an allegation that the governor groped a female aide at the Executive Mansion last year, Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually suggestive remarks and behavior toward women, including female aides. One aide said he asked her if she would ever have sex with an older man. And another aide claimed Cuomo once kissed her without consent, and said the governor’s aides publicly smeared her after she accused him of sexual harassment.</p> <p>The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has repeatedly said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both support the attorney general’s investigation into the harassment allegations.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>'},\n",

       "    'fields': {'body': '<p>An announcer for a live stream of an Oklahoma girls’ high school basketball game cursed and called one team by a racial epithet as the players knelt during the national anthem, then suggested his diabetes was to blame for the episode in a statement expressing his regret.</p> <p>The incident occurred on Thursday before the Norman High School-Midwest City quarter-final game in Sapulpa as the Star-Spangled Banner began to play. The broadcasters told their listeners on the NFHS Network stream they would return after a break and then one, apparently not realizing the audio was still live, used an expletive and the epithet as the Norman players knelt.</p> <p>“They’re kneeling? Fuck them,” one of the men said. “I hope Norman gets their ass kicked … I hope they lose. C’mon Midwest City. They’re gonna kneel like that? Hell no.” He went on to call the players the N-word.</p> <p>The incident was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CoachFParks/status/1370389926903226369\">posted on Twitter</a> and widely disseminated on Friday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CoachFParks/status/1370389926903226369\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NFHSNetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NFHSNetwork</a> looks like you forgot to cut the Mic!!! &quot;F****** N******&quot; is the one that really got me!!

Norman High School superintendent Nick Migliorino said the school district supports the students’ right to freely express themselves:</p> <p>“Last night during the Norman High School girls’ basketball game versus Midwest City in the Oklahoma 6A State Basketball Tournament, National Federation of High School (NFHS) Network announcers on a live stream broadcast made racist and hateful comments targeted at our Norman High student athletes. The announcers were contracted by OSSAA for the state tournament.</p> <p>“We condemn and will not tolerate the disgusting words and attitudes of these announcers. This type of hate speech has no place in our society and we are outraged that it would be directed at any human being, and particularly at our students.</p> <p>“We fully support our students’ right to freedom of expression and our immediate focus is to support these girls and their coaches and families, particularly our Black students and coaching staff. It is tragic that the hard work and skill of this team is being overshadowed by the vile, malignant words of these individuals. We will do everything in our power to support and uplift our team and everyone affected by this incident.</p> <p>“Moving forward NPS will rely only on our long-standing, community partner SportsTalk Media to live stream the remainder of the tournament, as we have full confidence in their proven ability to respectfully support our student athletes.”</p> <p>State public schools superintendent Joy Hofmeister also released a statement, saying the comments cannot be tolerated.</p> <p>“The remarks made were sickening and vile,” Hofmeister said. “My heart aches for the young female athletes who were subjected to this hateful and disgusting tirade.”</p> <p>Emily Virgin, the minority leader of Oklahoma’s state house of representatives, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyVirginOK/status/1370500703354023946/photo/1\">led a call for action</a> in the wake of the incident, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EmilyVirginOK/status/1370403246498574339\">said</a>: “I am absolutely disgusted by the actions of the broadcasters who used racist slurs against our Norman High basketball team. They should immediately resign or be fired. Our student athletes should be commended for their courage, not disparaged. Heartbreaking.”</p> <p>Norman mayor Breea Clark also issued a statement Friday morning, saying that she was “livid and absolutely disgusted about the racist and hateful comments directed towards the young women on the Norman High School basketball team by a game announcer in the live broadcast of last night’s game.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Breea Clark\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fclarkfornorman%2Fposts%2F3794380597294934&width=500&show_text=false&height=743&appId\" width=\"500\" height=\"743\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>She added: “These young athletes were simply expressing themselves as hundreds of professional athletes around the nation have done, and no one, let alone a child, deserves to experience this kind of racist and toxic behavior. The announcer could’ve stopped with declaring he hoped our team would lose, but instead he went further and decided to use profanity and racist slurs about our children.</p> <p>“Join me in calling for the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) to end their contract with the National Federation of High School (NFHS) Network. Their employees do not need to be anywhere near children. Further, these young women and their team deserve a public apology from NFHS and OSSAA. There is NO PLACE for this behavior in our nation, and certainly not in youth sports.”</p> <p>Norman was scheduled to play Tulsa Union at 4pm on Friday in the semi-finals at Sapulpa.</p> <p>• This article was amended on 13 March 2021 to remove a quote with the racist term that the announcer used.</p>'},\n",

      "<p>While Rory McIlroy’s struggles go on, Lee Westwood’s outstanding form continued. Just days after taking Bryson DeChambeau to the final hole at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Englishman added a 66 to his first-round 69 and leads by one shot from Matthew Fitzpatrick at the Players Championship.</p> <p>McIlroy has admitted a desire to add more length to his game, fuelled in part by DeChambeau’s power play at the 2020 US Open, has triggered technical problems that were visible here. A second round of 75 at Sawgrass, added to Thursday’s 79, meant McIlroy comfortably missed the cut. Afterwards, he expanded on the basis for his swing issues. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/10/tiger-woods-condition-car-crash-rory-mcilroy-golf\">Rory McIlroy says Tiger Woods is 'doing better' after car crash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>“Probably, like October last year, doing a little bit of speed training, started getting sucked into that stuff, swing got flat, long and too rotational,” said McIlroy. “Obviously I added some speed and am hitting the ball longer but what that did to my swing as a whole probably wasn’t a good thing. So I’m sort of fighting to get back out of that. That’s what I’m frustrated with.”</p> <p>When asked why he had embarked on such a journey, McIlroy’s answer raised eyebrows. “I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t anything to do with what Bryson did at the US Open,” said the four-times major winner. “I think a lot of people saw that and were like, ‘Whoa, if this is the way they’re going to set golf courses up in the future, it helps. It really helps.’</p> <p>“The one thing that people don’t appreciate is how good Bryson is out of the rough. Not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard, so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us, than other guys. I thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing, I got there. I just need to maybe rein it back in a little bit.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/mar/12/the-day-the-turf-stood-still-looking-back-at-sports-sudden-shutdown\">The day the turf stood still: looking back at sport's sudden shutdown </a> </p> </aside>  <p>As McIlroy headed home, Westwood, at nine under par, has aspirations of claiming the Players just a month before his 48th birthday.</p> <p>“I care less about the outcomes now,” said Westwood. “I still care about my performance and that in turn leads me to work as hard as I’ve always worked. But I’ve been working with a psychologist for a few years now and we just focus on the process, we don’t focus on the outcomes and things we can’t control.”</p> <p>Fitzpatrick, who has made back-to-back 68s. Sergio García a further shot back, at seven under par, in third alongside Chris Kirk.</p>\n"
